## Description

This is the companion module used to deliver the tasks for the solutions and configurations described in Puppet Support knowledge base <https://support.puppet.com/hc/en-us>.

The knowledge base, available to our support customers, offers a range of self service solutions, ranging from fixes to known issues to  useful configuration and deployment options. Some of the knowledge base articles include an accompanying Puppet task to automate the configuration of these self service solutions, this module delivers these tasks.


## Setup

### Beginning with support_tasks

Tasks in this module should only be executed by PE support customers in accompaniment with the corresponding knowledge base article. The task name corresponds to the KB article number, for instance, article KB#9999 corresponds to task kb9999.

## Usage

Support customers should follow the instructions in the corresponding knowledge base articles linked below.


## Reference

To view the available actions and parameters for each task, on the command line, run `puppet task show <task_name>` or see the support\_tasks module page on the [Forge](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/support_tasks/tasks).
