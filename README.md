## Description

This is the companion module used to deliver the tasks for the solutions and configurations described in Puppet Support knowledge base <https://support.puppet.com/hc/en-us>.

The knowledge base, available to our support customers, offers a range of self service solutions, ranging from fixes to known issues to  useful configuration and deployment options. Some of the knowledge base articles include an accompanying Puppet task to automate the configuration of these self service solutions, this module delivers these tasks.
