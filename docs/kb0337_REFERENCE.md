# Reference

## Configuration

### ssh

By default, Bolt will assume the `ssh` transport and use `~/.ssh.config` for configuration options.  Below is a sample `config` file and command.

```
Host pe-*
  User centos
  Port 22
  PasswordAuthentication no
  IdentityFile /home/adrian/.ssh/id_rsa-acceptance
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  LogLevel ERROR
```

```
$ bolt plan run kb0337b_upload_ca_cert cert=/tmp/tmp.CuWtz3dmfx --run-as root --nodes pe-201815-agent
{
  "success": {
    "pe-201815-agent": {
      "_output": "Uploaded '/tmp/tmp.CuWtz3dmfx' to 'pe-201815-agent:/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem'"
    }
  }
}
```

### Inventory

See the [Bolt inventory](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/inventory_file.html) documentation for a full reference on how to use the inventory.  Below is a sample inventory created using [bolt-inventory-pdb](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/inventory_file_generating.html) and example commands.

```
$ cat pdb.yaml
---
query: "inventory[certname] {}"
groups:
- name: windows
  query: "inventory[certname] { facts.os.family = 'windows' }"
  config:
    transport: winrm
    winrm:
      user: Administrator
      password: foo
      ssl: false
- name: linux
  query: "inventory[certname] { facts.kernel = 'Linux' }"
  config:
    transport: ssh
    ssh:
      user: centos
      private-key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa-acceptance
      host-key-check: false
```

```
$ /opt/puppetlabs/bolt/bin/bolt-inventory-pdb pdb.yaml -o ~/.puppetlabs/bolt/inventory.yaml
```

```

## Plans

### `kb0337a_extend_ca_cert`

#### Arguments

* master - Fully qualified domain name of the master containing the certificate authority
* compile_masters - Comma separated list of fully qualified domain names of compile masters

#### Steps

* Runs the `service` task to stop the `puppet` and `pe-puppetserver` services on the master
* Runs the `kb0337a_extend_ca_cert` task to dump the new cert to a file and return the path to the file and a base64 encoded string of its contents
* Runs the `kb0337d_configure_master` task to backup the `ssl` directory to `/var/puppetlabs/backups`, copy the new cert into place, and configure the master to use the new cert
* Decodes the cert's contents and dump it to a temp file
* Uploads the new cert to any compile masters and configures them to use the new cert

#### Output

All steps in this plan are critical to extending the certificate, so the plan will fail if any step fails.  The output consists of Bolt logging messages and any failures of the steps involved.

### Example

```

### `kb0337b_upload_ca_cert`

#### Arguments

*  cert - Location of the new certificate on disk.

This plan accepts any valid TargetSpec(s) specified by the `--nodes` option.

#### Steps

* Collects facts from agents and separates them into groups of \*nix and Windows
* Runs `upload_file` on each list of agents to distribute the cert
* Constructs a JSON formatted object of the results of the uploads and returns it

#### Output

The output of this plan is a JSON object with two keys: `success` and `failure`.  Each key contains any number of objects consisting of the agent certname and the output of the `upload_file` command.

## Tasks

### `kb0337g_check_ca_expiry`

#### Arguments

* cert - Optional location of certificate on disk to check.  Defaults to /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem.
* date - Optional YYYY-MM-DD format date against which to check for expiration. Defaults to 3 months in the future.

This task accepts any valid TargetSpec(s) specified by the `--nodes` option. Can be run on any \*nix agent node or the master.

#### Steps

* Uses `openssl` and Unix `date` to determine if the certificate will expire.

#### Output

A JSON object with the status and expiration date, e.g.

```
{
  "status": "valid",
  "expiry date": "Feb 16 01:00:09 2034 GMT"
}
```

### `kb0337f_check_agent_expiry`

#### Arguments

* date - Optional YYYY-MM-DD format date against which to check for expiration

This task accepts any valid TargetSpec(s) specified by the `--nodes` option. Should be run on the master.

#### Steps

* Uses `openssl` and Unix `date` to determine if the signed agent certificates under `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ca/signed/` will expire.

#### Output

A JSON object with keys for valid and expiring certificates, e.g.

```
  {
    "valid": [
      "/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ca/signed/c4lscpmafhaxjr8.delivery.puppetlabs.net.pem",
      "/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ca/signed/cd4pe-containers.platform9.puppet.net.pem",

      "/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ca/signed/mafy3pgo98v2vne.delivery.puppetlabs.net.pem",
      "/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ca/signed/pe-201901-agent.platform9.puppet.net.pem",
      "/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ca/signed/pe-201901-compile.puppetdebug.vlan.pem",
      "/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ca/signed/pe-201901-master.puppetdebug.vlan.pem",

    ],
    "expiring": [

    ]
  }
```
